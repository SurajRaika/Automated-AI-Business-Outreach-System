    Hi,<br><br>
    <strong>TL;DR</strong><br><br>
    Hello, I wanted to introduce myself as a remote developer.<br><br>
    And I've been thinking about applying to ManpowerGroup as a developer. I have seen your work and services you provide.<br><br>
    So, I’d like to join your team as a developer and contribute effectively to ongoing and upcoming projects.<br><br>
    
    Some of my work includes 
<a href="https://artifact.wuaze.com" target="_blank">Artisan's Direct Exchange</a> (a marketplace-style platform), 
<a href="https://www.rayca.in/projects" target="_blank">DuckSurvey</a> (a user-facing survey product), 
<a href="https://github.com/SurajRaika/OutreachPilot" target="_blank">OutreachPilot</a> (an LLM-based automation and outreach system), 
and <a href="https://taxi.rayca.in/" target="_blank">NRTours</a> (a real-world booking and customer-facing application)

    and a <a href="https://www.rayca.in/apps" target="_blank">collection of public online tools</a>.<br><br>
    
    You can explore more of my work on my <a href="https://www.rayca.in/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> 
    or view my freelance profile on <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01e307344c31edcc38" target="_blank">Upwork</a>.<br><br>

    I’m comfortable working across frontend and backend, building automation, managing databases, and even tackling cross-platform apps. I adapt quickly, enjoy collaborating, and focus on creating solutions that are both reliable and easy to maintain.
    <br>
   I hope you might keep me in mind if any projects come up where I could help out. I’d be happy to pitch in on anything you have in mind. I’m based in Udaipur.<br><br>
    
    Best,<br>
    Suraj Raika<br><br>
